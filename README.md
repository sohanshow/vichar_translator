### Sant Nirankari Mission AI Vichar Translator (Beta: NY Branch)

This is an effort to translate vichar to English in Sangats real time using speech
recognition and translation.

`translator.py`: This is the initial script that does the recording and translation.

To test this out please follow the below:

1. `touch .env` in terminal.
2. Create an entry called `OPENAI_API_KEY:` then put your API key
3. Then run the script via: `python3 translator.py`

This is a very initial script and is subject to complete change upon discussion.

Currently the output is in console but we shall create an application to push it
in any format required.
